# Static Portfolio Website Generated with Zola
By Daniel Medina

## Overview
In this project, I use Zola and the adidoks template to serve my personal portfolio website. While the site is currently not running, you can find a screenshot of the site running below. As I add projects and secure a domain name in the coming weeks, I will have the site running permanently.
